## Cosc440 @ UC 2024
### Deep learning


I aim to sufficiently comment all code in this repository and provide summary / annotated notes.

This is for the 2024 S2 paper. Presumably copying these solutions is simply going to fail / raise a red flag in the case that changes are made by the uni. 


Grading / completeness update:

  Code is 100% functional, noted that there's some redundancy in the np calls in backprop. 


I can't add onenote docs apparently anymore, but here's my (very messy and very scatterbrained) notes from onenote covering the first term of the course
