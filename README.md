## Deep learning


I aim to sufficiently comment all code in this repository and provide summary / annotated notes.

This is for the 2024 S2 paper. Presumably copying these solutions is simply going to fail / raise a red flag in the case that changes are made by the uni. 


Grading / completeness update:

  Code is 100% functional, noted that there's some redundancy in the np calls in backprop. 


Turns out that exporting onenote to pdf arrives at a filesize of 800mb. I've just popped some 4k screenshots into notes. Messy? scatterbrained? Yes!








### What's this?

If you squint really hard, you can see the labels in the images. Ass 3 generates this from the decoder half of an autoencoder and I thought it was neat!
